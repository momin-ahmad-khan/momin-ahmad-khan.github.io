I am a fifth-year PhD student at UMass Amherst, working with Professor [Fatima Anwar](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/). My areas of interest are the security and privacy of distributed machine learning systems. I have worked on designing new attacks and defenses for Federated Learning (FL) and uncovering experimental pitfalls in the robustness evaluations of existing attacks and defenses.

Currently, I am a research intern at Nokia Bell Labs in the Autonomous Systems Research Group, where I am working on mechanistic interpretability for embodied AI.
In the summer of 2024, I was a research intern in the same group at Bell Labs. I worked on designing model selection and code generation pipelines using various LLM agents and tools. Additionally, I developed a smart meeting manager utilizing LLMs, computer vision models, and hardware components to automate the orchestration and conduct of meetings without human intervention.

I am a fifth-year PhD student at UMass Amherst, advised by Professor [Fatima Anwar](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/). My research spans the security and robustness of distributed AI systems, large language models (LLMs), and vision-language models (VLMs). I’ve worked on designing attacks and defenses for Federated Learning (FL), identifying pitfalls in robustness evaluations, and improving prompt learning through more reliable and interpretable optimization techniques.

Recently, I completed my second internship at Nokia Bell Labs, where I focused on mechanistic interpretability for embodied AI agents—probing perception-action loops using sparse autoencoders and grounded representations. In my first internship at Bell Labs, I developed agentic LLM systems for model selection and code generation, and built a smart meeting assistant integrating LLMs, VLMs, and hardware. I’m currently exploring techniques like DPO and GRPO to enhance grounding and alignment in VLMs and multi-agent settings.

Before joining UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk) at the [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk) in 2021. I graduated with a gold medal for best thesis project and a silver medal for the second-highest GPA in my batch.

Besides work, I am learning to play the guitar. I love to travel alone, and I have started a [photography page](https://www.instagram.com/tanha_safar.__/) to document my adventures. I enjoy cooking and continue to try out new recipes. But most of all, I love playing Dota 2, and I am in the top 10% of players globally!
