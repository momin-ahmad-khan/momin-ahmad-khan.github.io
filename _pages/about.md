I am a fifth-year PhD student at UMass Amherst, working with Professor [Fatima Anwar](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/). My areas of interest are the security and privacy of distributed machine learning systems. I have worked on designing new attacks and defenses for Federated Learning (FL) and uncovering experimental pitfalls in the robustness evaluations of existing attacks and defenses.

Currently, I am a research intern at Nokia Bell Labs in the Autonomous Systems Research Group, where I am working on mechanistic interpretability for embodied AI.
In the summer of 2024, I was a research intern in the same group at Bell Labs. I worked on designing model selection and code generation pipelines using various LLM agents and tools. Additionally, I developed a smart meeting manager utilizing LLMs, computer vision models, and hardware components to automate the orchestration and conduct of meetings without human intervention.

Before joining UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk) at the [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk) in 2021. I graduated with a gold medal for best thesis project and a silver medal for the second-highest GPA in my batch.

Besides work, I am learning to play the guitar. I enjoy cooking and continue to try out new recipes. But most of all, I love playing Dota 2, and I am in the top 10% of players globally!
